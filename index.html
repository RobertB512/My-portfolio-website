              Hey, I'm Robert! I am an aspiring front-end web developer. I am largely <span class="highlight">self taught</span>, but also have plans to <span class="highlight">join a bootcamp at "General Assembly"</span>, after I finish with another web development program I am taking.

            <p>
              A little more about me and some things I like/enjoy. (not coffee, by the way ðŸ™‚). I do enjoy computers, such as frontend web development and the iPhone/iPad (not the code, just the products), playing mobile games, watching TV shows and movies (currently PokÃ©mon and Monk). I also enjoy hanging with friends in my free time, and going out to eat.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some small things I find interesting, though rarely spend time on them, are optical illusions and paradoxes.
